            <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Luna Amazon</li>
                <li><a href="https://luna.amazon.com/" target="_blank">luna.amazon.com</a></li>
            </ul>
            <div id="c1-img">
                <img id="img-1" src="images/monopoly-website.jpeg" alt="Image #1">
            </div>
            <p>
                This website applies the design principle of Visual Hierarchy because it has organized and prioritized 
                content to guide users' eyes. We have the “Monopoly Plus” banner that is displayed at the top with a great 
                size where the user can see it first. The call to action “Play the classic game” and “Learn More” are secondary 
                but still easily noticeable and this helps to form the hierarchy. Below we have a grid layout that showcases 
                various games available where their titles are clear and visuals are appealing, making it easy for users to find 
                their favorite game. Also, every game's visual is accompanied by a title ensuring users can quickly identify and 
                select their preferred games. Lastly, to say that this website also applies the design principle of Contrast that 
                helps to differentiate between elements and to create a focal point.

            <h3>PARC: Alignment</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>IBM</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.ibm.com/us-en" target="_blank">ibm.com</a></li>
            </ul>
            <div id="c2-img">
                <img id="img-2" src="images/ibm-website.jpeg" alt="Image #2">
            </div>
            <p>
                The alignment principle is applied here because we have the elements of the page, such as headlines, subheadings, 
                and call-to-action buttons, aligned vertically. This helps to provide a clear visual path for the user and makes it 
                easier to read. Also, we have the text blocks aligned to the left of the website, which helps to keep it organized 
                and maintain visual harmony. The “Try for Free” and “Meet watsonx.ai” buttons are aligned next to each other, 
                creating a sense of balance and making it easy for users to see their options. They guide the viewer's eye through 
                the content, making it easier to navigate and understand.

            <h3>PARC: Repetition</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Visme</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.visme.co/" target="_blank">visme.co</a></li>
            </ul>
            <div id="c3-img">
                <img id="img-3" src="images/visme-website.jpeg" alt="Image #3">
            </div>
            <p>This website applies the principle of repetition because it uses similar elements throughout a design. For example, 
                the font in this website in the headline and subheading uses the same font and style, creating a clear and consistent 
                message that is easy to read. Also, the colors gray, white, and blue are repeated, and this helps to have a cohesive look. 
                Lastly, we have the icons that are very similar with the same color and the stars with the same shape and color too. Even 
                though they are logos from different companies, the principle of repetition helps them stay similar and pleasing to the eye.
